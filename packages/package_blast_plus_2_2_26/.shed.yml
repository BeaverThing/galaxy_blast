long_description: |
  This Tool Shed package is intended to be used as a dependency of the Galaxy wrappers
  for NCBI BLAST+ and any other tools which call the BLAST+ binaries internally.

  Note that there are separate packages for later releases of BLAST+ which often add
  tools, or change options.

  Development is hosted on GitHub https://github.com/peterjc/galaxy_blast/ which can
  be used for reporting any issues.
