Galaxy wrappers for NCBI BLAST+ suite
=====================================

These wrappers are copyright 2010-2012 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

Currently tested with NCBI BLAST 2.2.26+ (i.e. version 2.2.26 of BLAST+),
and do not work with the NCBI 'legacy' BLAST suite (e.g. blastall).

Note that these wrappers were originally distributed as part of the main
Galaxy repository, but as of August 2012 moved to the Galaxy Tool Shed.
My thanks to Dannon Baker from the Galaxy development team for this assistance
with this.


Manual Installation
===================

For those not using Galaxy's automated installation from the Tool Shed, put
the XML and Python files under tools/ncbi_blast_plus and add the XML files
to your tool_conf.xml as normal.

You must tell Galaxy about any system level BLAST databases using configuration
files blastdb.loc (nucleotide databases like NT) and blastdb_p.loc (protein
databases like NR).

You will also need to install the 'blast_datatypes' from the Tool Shed. This
defines the BLAST XML file format ('blastxml').


History
=======

v0.0.11 - Final revision as part of the Galaxy main repository, and the
          first release via the Tool Shed
v0.0.12 - Implements genetic code option for translation searches.
        - Changes <parallelism> to 1000 sequences at a time (to cope with
          very large sets of queries where BLAST+ can become memory hungry)
        - Include warning that BLAST+ with subject FASTA gives pairwise
          e-values


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ ./tools/ncbi_blast_plus/make_ncbi_blast_plus.sh

This similifies ensuring a consistent set of files is bundled each time,
including all the relevant test files.
