Galaxy tool to find BLAST Reciprocal Best Hits (RBH)

This tool is a short Python script to run reciprocal BLAST searches on a
pair of sequence files, and extract the reciprocal best hits.

This is a work in progress, and builds on an earlier implementation which
prequired the two BLAST searches be prepared in advance. Integration allows
a much simpler user experience, and can ensure sensible filters are used.
