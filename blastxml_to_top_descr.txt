Galaxy tool to extract top BLAST hit descriptions from BLAST XML
================================================================

This tool is copyright 2012-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This tool is a short Python script to parse a BLAST XML file, and extract the
identifiers with description for the top matches (by default the top 3), and
output these as a simple tabular file along with the query identifiers.

This requires the 'blast_datatypes' repository from the Galaxy Tool Shed
to provide the 'blastxml' file format definition.


Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically install the
'blast_datatypes' dependency.



Manual Installation
===================

If you haven't done so before, first install the 'blast_datatypes' repository.

There are just two files to install (if doing this manually):

* blastxml_to_top_descr.py (the Python script)
* blastxml_to_top_descr.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)

The suggested location is in the Galaxy folder tools/ncbi_blast_plus next to
the NCBI BLAST+ tool wrappers.

You will also need to modify the tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer
the tool. e.g. next to the NCBI BLAST+ tools. Simply add the line:

<tool file="filters/seq_select_by_id.xml" />

To run the tool's tests, also add this line to tools_conf.xml.sample then:

$ sh run_functional_tests.sh -id blastxml_to_top_descr


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial version.
v0.0.2 - Since BLAST+ was moved out of the Galaxy core, now have a dependency
         on the 'blast_datatypes' repository in the Tool Shed.


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf blastxml_to_top_descr.tar.gz tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blastxml_to_top_descr.* tools/ncbi_blast_plus/repository_dependencies.xml

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf blastxml_to_top_descr.tar.gz
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blastxml_to_top_descr.py
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blastxml_to_top_descr.txt
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blastxml_to_top_descr.xml
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/repository_dependencies.xml
