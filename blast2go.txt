Galaxy wrapper for Blast2GO for pipelines, b2g4pipe
===================================================

This wrapper is copyright 2011-2013 by Peter Cock, The James Hutton Institute
(formerly SCRI, Scottish Crop Research Institute), UK. All rights reserved.
See the licence text below.

This is a wrapper for the command line Java tool b2g4pipe v2.5,
Blast2GO for pipelines. See:

Installation
============

The main dependency is b2g4pipe which must be installed manually. Also we
strongly recommend installing a local Blast2GO database as well (see the
intructions below about the blast2go.loc file). At the time of writing,
the current version is b2g4pipe v2.5 which is available here:

http://www.blast2go.com/data/blast2go/b2g4pipe_v2.5.zip

You can change the path by editing the definition near the start of the Python
script blast2go.py, but by default it expects the underlying tool to be here:

/opt/b2g4pipe_v2.5/blast2go.jar

Installation of the Galaxy wrapper should work automatically via the Galaxy
Tool Shed, including the dependency on 'blast_datatypes' for the 'blastxml'
file format definition. To install the wrapper manually, first install
'blast_datatypes', then copy or move the following files under the Galaxy
tools folder, e.g. in the tools/ncbi_blast_blast folder:

* blast2go.xml (the Galaxy tool definition)
* blast2go.py (the Python wrapper script)
* blast2go.txt (this README file)

For a manual installation of the wrapper you will also need to modify the
tools_conf.xml file to tell Galaxy to offer the tool. We suggest putting
it next to the NCBI BLAST+ wrappers. Just add the line:

<tool file="ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.xml" />

As part of setting up b2g4pipe you will need to setup one or more Blast2GO
property files which tell the tool which database to use etc. The example
b2gPipe.properties provided with b2g4pipe is often out of date. The current
server IP address and database name may given on the Blast2GO website, or
can be found by running the latest GUI version via Java web-start, and
looking under the tools/options menu. These property files can be anywhere
accessable to the Galaxy Unix user, we put them with the JAR file etc.

You must tell Galaxy about these Blast2GO property files so that they can be
offered to the user. Copy file blast2go.loc.sample to tool-data/blast2go.loc
under the Galaxy folder and edit this to match your installation. This must
be plain text, tab separated, with three columns:

(1) ID for the setup, e.g. Spain_2012_August
(2) Description for the setup, e.g. Database in Spain (August 2012)
(3) Properties filename for the setup, e.g. /opt/b2g4pipe/Spain_2012_August.properties

Avoid including "Blast2GO" in the description (column 2) as this text will be
included in the automatically assigned output dataset name. The blast2go.loc
file allows you to customise the database setup. If for example you have a local
Blast2GO server running (which we recommend for speed), and you want this to be
the default setting, include it as the first line in your blast2go.loc file.

Consult the Blast2GO documentation for details about the property files and
setting up a local MySQL Blast2GO database.


History
=======

v0.0.1 - Initial public release
v0.0.2 - Documentation clarifications, e.g. concatenated BLAST XML is allowed.
       - Fixed error handler in wrapper script (for when b2g4pipe fails).
       - Reformats the XML to use old NCBI-style concatenated BLAST XML since
         b2g4pipe crashes with heap space error on with large files using
         current NCBI output.
v0.0.3 - Include sample loc file, tool-data/blast2go.loc.sample
v0.0.4 - Include repository_dependencies.xml file for 'blastxml' format
         (previously included in the core Galaxy installation)
v0.0.5 - Quote arguments in case of spaces in filenames (internal change)
       - Last release supporting b2g4pipe v2.3.5
v0.0.6 - Support for b2g4pipe v2.5 instead of v2.3.5
          - Now invoked with a class path and es.blast2go.prog.B2GAnnotPipe
            rather then simply calling the jar file
          - Now uses the switch -annot instead of -a (this change breaks
            support for b2g4pipe v2.3.5 unfortunately)
       - Catch a few error messages and treat them explicitly as errors.


Developers
==========

This script and related tools are being developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

For making the "Galaxy Tool Shed" http://community.g2.bx.psu.edu/ tarball I use
the following command from the Galaxy root folder:

$ tar -czf blast2go.tar.gz tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.xml tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.py tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.txt tools/ncbi_blast_plus/repository_dependencies.xml tool-data/blast2go.loc.sample

Check this worked:

$ tar -tzf blast2go.tar.gz
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.xml
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.py
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/blast2go.txt
tools/ncbi_blast_plus/repository_dependencies.xml
tool-data/blast2go.loc.sample
